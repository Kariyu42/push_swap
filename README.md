# push_swap

## 1st 42 algorithm project.

We are given 2 stacks. A and B. We are given a list of completely random numbers in stack A. Our job is to organise this list from smallest number to the biggest.

Rules:
  - Organise from smallest to biggest stack A.
  - We are only allowed specific moves in order to manipulate the stacks.
  - Do it in the least amount of moves.
