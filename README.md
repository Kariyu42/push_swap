# push_swap ðŸ”¢

## Our 1st 42 algorithm project.

Push_swap is a sorting algorithm project that requires you to write a C program that sorts a stack of integers using only a limited set of operations. You must implement two sorting algorithms, one for small input sizes and another for larger ones. The challenge is that you only have two stacks to work with, and the goal is to minimize the number of operations required to sort the stack.
| Operations | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| sa | Swap the first two elements in stack A. |
| sb | Swap the first two elements in stack B. |
| ss | Swap the first two elements in stack A and stack B simultaneously. |
| pa | Takes the first element of stack B and puts it up top of stack A. |
| pb | Takes the first element of stack B and puts it up top of stack A. |
| ra | Take the first element and put it to the bottom of stack A. |
| rb | Take the first element and put it to the bottom of stack B. |
| rr | Take the first element of both stacks, and put both elements at the bottom of their respective stacks. |
| rra | Take the last element and put it to the top of stack A. |
| rrb | Take the last element and put it to the top of stack B. |
| rrr | Take the last element of both stacks, and put both elements at the top of their respective stacks. |
